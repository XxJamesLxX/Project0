			My name is James and I am a university student. My course is Computer Science and currently I am studying the internet and how to build web applications. My goal in this subject is to build dynamic webpages and comprehend both front-end techniques, such as bootstrap, and back-end techniques, such as SQL and database.I also have many hobies, including playing sports, watching movies and TV shows, studying applied phyiscs and chemistry, and reading books.

			<h2 id="Topic 1">Favourite Sports</h2>
			<div>
				I have done lots of different kinds of sports when I was young, these sports include tennis, basketball, soccer, table tennis and swimming. Among these sports, tennis is my favourite. I enjoy the way of combat of tennis, the sound my tennis racket produces everytime I hit the ball and the amount of calorie I can burn after each game. Besides tennis, swimming is also enjoyable to me.

			<h2 id="Topic 2">Favourite Movies</h2>
			<div>
				Two types of movies I enjoy the most are Sci-Fi movies and suspension movies. This does not mean that I do not like other movies, but majority of the movies I watched falls into these two categories. Among Sci-Fi movies, I enjoy the Avengers the most, largely becuase of the amazing story line and the different kinds of abilities of the characters in that movie. For suspension movies, Identity is my favourite due to its occasionally horrible scene and unique ending.
			</div>
			<h2 id="Topic 3">Favourite Scientists</h2>
			<div>
				Although I study computer science, I also love other science subjects, especially physics and chemistry. The quantum world and the universe attracts me strongly and I have read a lot of different texts to gain more understanding about them. On the other hand, I am also fascinated by organic chemistry and how different materials can be synthesised for specific purposes. As a science fan, my favourite scientist is Erwin Schrodinger due to his contribution to quantum physics and his thinking experiment (i.e. Schrodinger's cat).
			</div>
			<h2 id="Topic 4">Favourite TV Shows</h2>
			<div>
				The types of TV shows I like is similar with that of the movies I enjoy. Among all of the TV shows I watched, Sherlock Holmes is the only one I watched twice. The story of each episode and the extraordinary acting skills of Benedict Cumberbatch are the key reasons of why I enjoyed this TV show.
			</div>
			<h2 id="Topic 5">Favourite Books</h2>
			<div>
				I also read different kinds of books, unlike my apetite to movies and TV shows, I love non-fiction books the most. I found out that I can learn a lot of different things through reading a book and many books I read in the last few years more or less influenced my perspective to many things. These books include A Brief History of Human Kind, A Brief History of the Future, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (these three are written by the same author), Zero to One, Elon Musk, the Gene, Freakonomics, How to Make Friends and Influence People and so on. Therefore, it is really hard to pick which books are my favourite.
